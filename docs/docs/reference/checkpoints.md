# Checkpoints

You can [compile][langgraph.graph.MessageGraph.compile] any LangGraph workflow with a [CheckPointer][basecheckpointsaver] to give your agent "memory" by persisting its state. This permits things like:

- Remembering things across multiple interactions
- Interrupting to wait for user input
- Resilience for long-running, error-prone agents
- Time travel retry and branch from a previous checkpoint

Key checkpointer interfaces and primitives are defined in [`langgraph_checkpoint`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/tree/main/libs/checkpoint) library.
